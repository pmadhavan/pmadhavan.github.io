    <h4>Action</h4>
    <div class="project-action-sub-head">Requirement Gathering:</div>
    <p>
      The project started with requirement gathering session with the Research professor Dr. Candice Mills at ThinkLab (UT Dallas). The basic requirement was to recreate the existing power point slides to a tablet application for performing research studies.

    </p>

    <p>
      The requirements of the project was quite ambiguous at the beginning. After a series of interview sessions with the stakeholders like Dr.Mills and rest of the team, I narrowed down a set of requirements.

    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, I observed the end users (i.e. kids in this case) using the power point slides while participating in research study conducted by the research team. As an outcome a lot of other requirements were uncovered.
    </p>

    <p>
      One such thing was saving every action of the user interaction in the database. During the traditional research method, a researcher has to note down important details of the experiment manually in pen and paper. Later on, he/she has to enter it again manually in excel for analysis.
      But I explained the possibility of saving such data in database in an effort to remove the cumbersome manual data entry.

  </p>
<p>
  Similar to the previous example, some more benefits of tablet app over power point slides were identified and defined as the scope of this project.

<p>
  I sketched an end to end user flow based on the collected requirements which opened the door for everyone to comment and offer other alternatives.

<p>
  At the beginning of prototyping sessions, most of the requirements were nailed down already and so this session helped me to focus on the actual interaction design and UI patterns. Since the users were young children, designing interfaces for them were pretty challenging.  I used wire framing and prototyping tools such as “Pencil” and “Axure” to create mockup screens. These screens were shown to the entire research crew on a frequent basis to get insights.

<div class="project-action-sub-head">Prioritization and Development
</div>
<p>
  Due to tight deadlines and the ambiguity of the project, I approached it in incremental steps and structured it in order to deliver minimum viable products. The entire project was developed in two phases,
</p>
<p>
<p>  Phase I: (Jan’15-May’15)</p>
<ul>  <li>Developed the first app “SEE” which comprised all the basic functionalities of the power point slides along with automatic data(User Interaction) collection. Kids were the main users of this app.</li>
<li>  In addition, I also developed the second app “SEE DB”. The main functionality of this app is just data retrieval from the first app. Researchers were the main user group.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
  <p>Phase-II: (Aug’15-Dec’15)</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Worked on adding more functionalities to the already developed “SEE” app such as adding replay of the audio explanation, counting the number of replays and storing it the database and etc.</li>

<li>  The research team wanted to have flexibility in changing the main factors affecting the research study. Some of the important factors were
  <ul>
    <li>  The limited number of more information accessibility. For example: among 12 animals a kid can access more information only for 5 animals. This number can/will change in every experiment.</li>
  <li>The order of images arranged in a grid. Among 12 sets of animals few explanations will be circular and few others will be non-circular. So, the team wanted to control the order in which images are displayed for every experiment.</li>
  <li>Having different versions of the experiment in the Tablet ready so as to conduct research study in a child care/school setting.</li>
  <li>Exporting the stored data from android’s database to .CSV files so as to perform analysis on a desktop.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Adding such flexibility to an already designed and developed app was very challenging since it required a complete makeover of the design. I quickly redesigned the application to accommodate the new requirement. It was interesting to design and handle two different user groups (Kids and Researchers) for the same app.

</p>
<div class="project-action-sub-head">Fine Tuning and Documentation:

</div>
<p>
<p>  Phase-III (Jan’16-May’16)</p>

This additional phase involved rigorous user testing and in turn fine tuning the interface. The research study were conducted across large audiences like child care and schools.  Hence, it provided a lot of valuable feedback and I had opportunity to change the interaction styles according to the feedback.

</p>

<p>
  In addition, the phase-III also involved documenting the app’s installation and user guide for the upcoming research team. I also captured all my design decisions and put together a developer guide for continuing development in future.

    <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
    <h6>Beyond UX:
</h6>
  <p >
    As a sole project owner, I was able to lead the project from start to finish. It was nearly a year long project and I took up the responsibilities to stay organized without any supervision. Prioritizing tasks, scope management and frequent status updates were some of the key skills I learnt during this project.
  </p>
  <section>
  <h4>Challenges</h4>
  <p>


    <h6>UX/UI for kids:</h6>

<p>

    One of the intriguing and challenging part in this project was designing interfaces for kids. Even though some of the common design principles apply for both adults and kids, some of them were not applicable for kids. Anticipating what kids might do in the interface and designing all the required elements were the difficult part. However, user testing revealed more unknowns and gave a chance to address those.
  </p>
  <p>
    To quote an example, the application had an logout icon to exit when the experiment is done, this was required for the researchers to start a new experiment with the next kid. A curious little boy clicked on the logout button as soon as he logged in, since he knew thats an exit to get out of the app, he was doing it even while the experiment was on and this affected the results of the experiment. Such peculiar behavior made me to approach the design in a different way for kids; I changed the interaction method of the logout button to a long press instead of just a tap. In that way, only a  researcher can logout of the app once the experiment is done.
