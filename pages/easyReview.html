          Following user research, I explored existing reviewing system such as yelp, amazon, google review, seamless and etc, that users frequently use to either read or write a review. The main aim of this process was to get inspiration from already existing services at the same time to consider a totally different path that others did not take if necessary.  This session was a sort of competitor analysis cum ideation which set the stage for storyboarding.

      <p>
        As a budding UX designer, I identified a behavioral problem and devised a design solution to enhance user experience. I understood, the solution involves steady refinement of the design based on user testing and other evaluation methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, users can rate certain qualities of the restaurant with a rating scale 1 to 5 points (Radio buttons). In the first iteration, the rating scale did not visually represent its respective values i.e. does scale 5 supposed to mean extremely bad or extremely good? However, one of the early heuristic evaluation revealed a potential usability assumption or mental model mismatch if you will and helped me to work on it in the next iteration.
