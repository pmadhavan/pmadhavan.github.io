      <p>
        My researching methods was a combination of interviews and user observation sessions.This is because, a sandwich of observation technique between two interview sessions helped me to dig deeper into the user needs.
      <ul>
        <li>Asking participants to answer few general questions at the beginning to set the stage.</li>
      <li>  Next observing them perform a task of reviewing a restaurant for the last visited one. </li>
      <li>  In addition to this, a final interview session addressing specific questions to explore the experience they just had performing the task worked out well to identify user needs and find design opportunities for innovation.</li>

        <p>
          Following user research, I explored existing reviewing system such as yelp, amazon, google review, seamless and etc, that users frequently use to either read or write a review. The main aim of this process was to get inspiration from already existing services at the same time to consider a totally different path that others did not take if necessary.  This session was a sort of competitor analysis cum ideation which set the stage for storyboarding.

          <li>Who are my user?</li>
          <li>When will this app be used?</li>
        <li>  What can motivate the user to use the app?</li>
        <li>  What will the user get in return for using my app?</li>

          <p>
            After brainstorming with story boarding, next step was to turn the sketches into experience. After careful analysis of each design solutions, I came up with a design that connected the dots and fulfilled the user needs. The final prototyping processes was iterative with steps like Design, Review, and Refine in every iteration.

          <p>
            After developing a fully functional prototype, it was time to test it with the real users. This was the second iteration of reviewing the design. User testing was very important at this stage to observe and get insights of the experience the app offered to the end users. To manage the user tests properly and to get maximum feedback out of it, I developed user evaluation plan and user test scripts. I also identified 3 participants to conduct user testing. Below is the picture taken while testing.

            has satisfied the user’s need. A behavior pattern was defined and list of changes to the current design was identified to implement in the next phase of the project.

      <div class="sub-headers"><strong>Iterative Design and Development:</strong></div>

      <p>
        As a budding UX designer, I identified a behavioral problem and devised a design solution to enhance user experience. I understood, the solution involves steady refinement of the design based on user testing and other evaluation methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, users can rate certain qualities of the restaurant with a rating scale 1 to 5 points (Radio buttons). In the first iteration, the rating scale did not visually represent its respective values i.e. does scale 5 supposed to mean extremely bad or extremely good? However, one of the early heuristic evaluation revealed a potential usability assumption or mental model mismatch if you will and helped me to work on it in the next iteration.

          Even though the user flow and experience of the app is well crafted, the UI still need lots of improvement. Few things are:

          <li>Aesthetic aspects of the interface.</li>
            <span class=" text-italic-light text-small-light"> Removing conspicuous background image in every page of the final prototype.</span>
